                    WeWander is a city discovery app which helps users discover attractions, restaurants and venues in a faster, more convenient way. By using a Tinder-like swipe mechanism, the user gets information about places of interest from a deck of cards pulled from our library. You can swipe right to save place to your offline map or left to never see it again. You can filter new cards or save cards by distance or type of activity to see the most relevant restaurants, attractions or sites of special interest nearby. With WeWander, you no longer need to browse through hundreds of pages to find what youâ€™re looking for.
WeWander was built with Ionic 2, Google Maps API, Native APIs, Third Party Libraries, GIT.
